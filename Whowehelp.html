      Who we work with
    </h2>
    <p class="editable">
      While we firmly believe that anyone can benefit from outsourced administrative support, there are certain types of people and companies that best suit our style.
    </p>

    <p class="editable">
      You&rsquo;ll get the most out of a relationship with us if you are ready to let go of some areas of your business, if you&rsquo;re open to change, and if you&rsquo;re open to suggestions for process improvements - if you&rsquo;re not going to get hung up on the way you&rsquo;ve &ldquo;always done it&rdquo;.
    </p>

    <p class="editable">
      Likewise, it works best if you&rsquo;re ready to commit to a longer-term relationship where we can truly get to know your business and your needs, and help empower you to achieve greater heights - or to achieve that important goal of spending more time with your family, actually taking holidays, filing your accounts on time, and so on.

          Caroline was my virtual EA for about 2 years before taking a career break for her maternity leave. Now, two years later, her skills are still legendary on my team, where she is remembered both fondly and with some degree of reverence. She is a wonderful combination of astute, organised, clever, resourceful, reliable and also very, very personable and easy to get along with. She simply ma<strong></strong><em></em>kes a good impression on everyone she comes into contact with - even, somehow, the person that she is kicking out of your diary at the last minute! I can't recommend her highly enough.

          Caroline is, quite simply, magic. My business admin was a total mess; 3 years of neglect meant my accounts, bookkeeping, projects and more were a nightmare. Caroline came in and sorted me out quickly, efficiently, and always with a smile. She is incredibly patient with my lack of organisation while still poking me with the proverbial stick as needed. I always thought a VA was a luxury for a sole proprietor, but she's a total asset and has taken a load off my shoulders so I can focus on servicing my clients first.
