      Trying to do it all yourself can be the quickest way to burnout, not to mention forgetting important duties or making mistakes. Upsource is a small team of virtual assistants, or VAs, who work side by side with you to help support and empower you on your journey to success - whatever form that support needs to take.

          "Caroline was my virtual EA for about 2 years before taking a career break for her maternity leave. Now, two years later, her skills are still legendary on my team, where she is remembered both fondly and with some degree of reverence. She is a wonderful combination of astute, organised, clever, resourceful, reliable and also very, very personable and easy to get along with. She simply makes a good impression on everyone she comes into contact with - even, somehow, the person that she is kicking out of your diary at the last minute! I can't recommend her highly enough."

          "Caroline is the Liam Neeson of VAs. When a series of unfortunate events left me with an unpaid invoice and no one to turn to, she straightened everything out for me in a matter of days. Caroline is friendly, organised, and doggedly persistent. Having her in your corner is a huge weight off your shoulders when you&rsquo;re busy running a business. Hire her right now."

          "Working with Nadine and Caroline has been a dream. They came in at the perfect time, just when our business and the number of things we'd need to manage were both growing. We were stuck in a dangerous circle of doing too much and also being too busy to hand things over. As a company founder, handing responsibilities over is always hard at first, but now I don't know what I'd do without the Upsource team! Nadine is so on top of everything that I can truly spend time calmly focusing on building the company of my dreams. I strongly recommend anyone who wants to reach their goals get Upsource on board to help them get there. "
