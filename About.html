    </h2>
    <!-- <p class="emphasis"> Upsource was founded by Caroline Marshall. Caroline has worked for over 10 years as an EA for C-suite executives and as a virtual assistant for clients in an eclectic range of disciplines, from FinTech to HR; from marketing agencies to plumbers! Her extensive list of happy clients is a testament to her adaptability and her dedication to providing a personalised and professional service to any industry.</p>

    <p>Caroline’s inspiration for Upsource came a few years ago after, in the space of just 4 short months, she had her first child, returned to a new busy customer experience role and planned and executed her dream wedding. This experience really opened her eyes to the realities of being pushed to one’s limits and therefore the enormous value that outsourcing can provide any individual. </p>

    <p>Success looks different to everyone and at Upsource we appreciate that. Tell us what your success means and we will build a support plan tailored just to you. </p> -->

      Upsource was founded by Caroline Marshall (pictured), who believes anyone can achieve success (whatever that may look like) when they have the right support in all areas of their life and business.

    <p class="editable">
      &ldquo;I know what it&rsquo;s like to have too much on my plate,&rdquo; says Caroline. &ldquo;I was working long hours with a young baby and trying to organise my own wedding. Now I&rsquo;m building a business with a toddler at my heels. I know the impact it can have to get an extra pair of hands to take the load off - it can be life-changing, and that&rsquo;s not an exaggeration.
    </p>

    <p class="editable">
      &ldquo;If we can encourage busy people to take more holiday, to spend more time with their family, or just to spend an hour in the gym without looking at email, then we&rsquo;ve done our job. I believe everyone has an organised person inside them - they just need to know what works best for them.&rdquo;
    </p>

    <p class="editable">
      Outsourcing administration doesn&rsquo;t have to be a luxury; it can be a way of life. Working with Upsource can help you to focus on what really matters to you, to clear those big goals and work towards your dreams. We will take you by the hand if you need it, or just work alongside you to understand the best way we can empower you to achieve success.

        Meet our founder
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        Caroline is a former singer and an AmDram enthusiast, so feels drawn to creatives and life&rsquo;s more interesting personalities. She believes being a performer adds to her approach in that she understands how minds can struggle with structure. For years, Caroline juggled work with auditions, performing and family life, which made it essential she didn&rsquo;t drop any balls or miss any opportunities. She brings that ethos into Upsource, surrounding herself with a wide variety of different personalities to ensure she has the right assistant for anyone who comes through the virtual door.

        How we work
      </h3>
      <p class="editable">
        We don&rsquo;t have a set menu of services for you to choose from. We prefer to meet with you for an informal initial chat, and then match your requirements to a tailored support plan. We get to know you and your work style before personally selecting the right Upsourcer to fit your needs, goals and personality. All of our virtual assistants are insured, vetted and ICO registered.
