    <h2 class="big-bold"> Upsource Founder- Caroline </h2>
    <p class="emphasis"> Upsource was founded by Caroline Marshall. Caroline has worked for over 10 years as an EA for C-suite executives and as a virtual assistant for clients in an eclectic range of disciplines, from FinTech to HR; from marketing agencies to plumbers! Her extensive list of happy clients is a testament to her adaptability and her dedication to providing a personalised and professional service to any industry.</p>

    <p>Caroline’s inspiration for Upsource came a few years ago after, in the space of just 4 short months, she had her first child, returned to a new busy customer experience role and planned and executed her dream wedding. This experience really opened her eyes to the realities of being pushed to one’s limits and therefore the enormous value that outsourcing can provide any individual. </p>

    <p>Success looks different to everyone and at Upsource we appreciate that. Tell us what your success means and we will build a support plan tailored just to you. </p>

      <h3> Where do you work? </h3>
      <p> HQ is in London, but Caroline and her associates work virtually - so if you are committed to primarily virtual working, we can support you wherever you are based; that’s not to say that on-site visits cannot be arranged and or support for events provided. </p>

      <h3> How do you work</h3>
      <p> Caroline and the team don’t restrict themselves to a set list of services. Instead, we will have an initial chat with you and after that Caroline will summarise your needs and match your requirements to a tailored support plan and indeed to the correct team members for your needs.

        All virtual assistants are insured, vetted and ICO registered. </p>

      <h3> Software </h3>
      <p> We believe software is key not only for a smooth working relationship but for your security. This is something we take very seriously and discuss with you in detail during your consultation / onboarding stage. </p>
